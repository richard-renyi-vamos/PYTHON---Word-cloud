Creating a script that visualizes text can be done using various libraries in Python. One common approach is to use the wordcloud library to generate a word cloud based on the frequency of words in the text. Here's an example of how you can do this:

First, make sure you have the wordcloud and matplotlib libraries installed. If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install wordcloud matplotlib
Once you have the libraries installed, here's a Python script that asks the user for text input and visualizes it as a word cloud:

python
Copy code
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_word_cloud(text):
    wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, max_words=200, background_color='white').generate(text)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

def main():
    user_text = input("Enter the text: ")
    generate_word_cloud(user_text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This script will prompt you to enter text, then generate and display a word cloud based on the words in the text you entered.

Run this script in your Python environment, and when prompted, input the text you want to visualize. It will then create a word cloud based on the frequency of words in that text and display it using matplotlib.
